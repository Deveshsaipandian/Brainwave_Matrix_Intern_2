# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern_2
This project is part of my Brainwave Matrix internship. It focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model classifies text reviews as positive or negative using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization.
# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using NLP – Brainwave Matrix Task 2

This project was completed as part of my internship with **Brainwave Matrix**. It demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to classify text data into **positive** or **negative** sentiments.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline using Python and machine learning techniques. It involves:

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
